# Tell-Us-A-Climate-Story: NASA-Space-Apps-Challenge

This project analyzes and visualizes CO₂ and CH₄ emissions in Los Angeles using data from the Los Angeles Megacity Carbon Project. The study focuses on the years 2020 and 2021 to observe the impact of COVID-19 on greenhouse gas concentrations. The analysis is broken down into Pre-COVID, During-COVID, and Post-COVID periods, with a detailed monthly breakdown of emissions trends.

Interactive dashboards, created using Plotly Dash, display CO₂ and CH₄ levels for different regions in Los Angeles. The dashboards present clear bar graphs for each period, allowing users to explore how emissions changed over time, with a special emphasis on the decrease during the pandemic.
